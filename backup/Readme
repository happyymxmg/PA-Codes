This directory is set to store lastest complete different version HIJING programs.
And the specific functional version HIJING programs.

1.hijing2.554_DHC_onceISR.f

In this version, we modified the HIJING with Q-shadowing, decoherent effect by
modifying the gluons in ISR of a hard process.
We just keep the gluons in the last hard process's ISR. Put the former ISR gluons
back into its nucleon to compensate the collision energy for current hard collision.
